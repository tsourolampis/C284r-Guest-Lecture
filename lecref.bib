Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible.},

The idea is that nodes belonging to a sybil group are mostly connected among themselves so their routes will not intersect so frequently with the verifier.

Routes are fixed at each node, meaning that if a route enters a node A from node B, then the route will exit node A to node p(A) independently of B [the routing table at each node is a permutation of its neighbors].},

@article{carriere1997webquery,
	abstract = {Finding information located somewhere on the World-Wide Web is an error-prone and frustrating task. The WebQuery system offers a powerful new method for searching the Web based on connectivity and content. We do this by examining links among the nodes returned in a keyword-based query. We then rank the nodes, giving the highest rank to the most highly connected nodes. By doing so, we are finding ”hot spots” on the Web that contain information germane to a user's query. WebQuery not only ranks and filters the results of a Web query, it also extends the result set beyond what the search engine retrieves, by finding ”interesting” sites that are highly connected to those sites returned by the original query. Even with WebQuery filtering and ranking query results, the result sets can be enormous. So, we need to visualize the returned information. We explore several techniques for visualizing this information -- including cone trees, 2D graphs, 3D graphs, lists, and bullseyes -- and discuss the criteria for using each of the techniques.},

@article{xiong2004peertrust,

One way to minimize threats in such communities is to use community-based reputations to help estimate the trustworthiness of peers. We present PeerTrust - a reputation-based trust supporting framework, which includes a coherent adaptive trust model for quantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of peers based on a transaction-based feedback system, and a decentralized implementation of such a model over a structured P2P network. PeerTrust model has two main features. First, we introduce three basic trust parameters and two adaptive factors in computing trustworthiness of peers, namely, feedback a peer receives from other peers, the total number of transactions a peer performs, the credibility of the feedback sources, transaction context factor, and the community context factor. Second, we define a general trust metric to combine these parameters. Other contributions of the paper include strategies used for implementing the trust model in a decentralized P2P environment, evaluation mechanisms to validate the effectiveness and cost of PeerTrust model, and a set of experiments that show the feasibility and benefit of our approach.},

For example, in scientific literature datasets, there are dependencies among the references of a paper. Recent work on graphical models for relational data has demonstrated significant performance gains for models that exploit the dependencies among instances. In this paper, we present relational dependency networks (RDNs), a new form of graphical model capable of reasoning with such dependencies in a relational setting. We describe the details of RDN models and outline their strengths, most notably the ability to learn and reason with cyclic relational dependencies. We present RDN models learned on a number of real-world datasets, and evaluate the models in a classification context, showing significant performance improvements. In addition, we use synthetic data to evaluate the quality of model learning and inference procedures.},

	abstract = {Counting in general, and estimating the cardinality of (multi-) sets in particular, is highly desirable for a large variety of applications, representing a foundational block for the efficient deployment and access of emerging internetscale information systems. Examples of such applications range from optimizing query access plans in internet-scale databases, to evaluating the significance (rank/score) of various data items in information retrieval applications. The key constraints that any acceptable solution must satisfy are: (i) efficiency: the number of nodes that need be contacted for counting purposes must be small in order to enjoy small latency and bandwidth requirements; (ii) scalability, seemingly contradicting the efficiency goal: arbitrarily large numbers of nodes nay need to add elements to a (multi-) set, which dictates the need for a highly distributed solution, avoiding server-based scalability, bottleneck, and availability problems; (iii) access and storage load balancing: counting and related overhead chores should be distributed fairly to the nodes of the network; (iv) accuracy: tunable, robust (in the presence of dynamics and failures) and highly accurate cardinality estimation; (v) simplicity and ease of integration: special, solution-specific indexing structures should be avoided. In this paper, first we contribute a highly-distributed, scalable, efficient, and accurate (multi-) set cardinality estimator. Subsequently, we show how to use our solution to build and maintain histograms, which have been a basic building block for query optimization for centralized databases, facilitating their porting into the realm of internet-scale data networks.},

However the relentless rise of automatic unauthorized emails, a.k.a. spam is eroding away much of the attractiveness of email communication. Most of the attention dedicated to date to spam detection has focused on the content of the emails or on the addresses or domains associated with spam senders. Although methods based on these - easily changeable - identifiers work reasonably well they miss on the fundamental nature of spam as an opportunistic relationship, very different from the normal mutual relations between senders and recipients of legitimate email. Here we present a comprehensive graph theoretical analysis of email traffic that captures these properties quantitatively. We identify several simple metrics that serve both to distinguish between spam and legitimate email and to provide a statistical basis for models of spam traffic.},

@inproceedings{XDMW06,
	abstract = {PageRank-style (PR) link analyses are a cornerstone of Web search engines and Web mining, but they are computationally expensive. Recently, various techniques have been proposed for speeding up these analyses by distributing the link graph among multiple sites, typically, the sites that own the corresponding pages. Exploiting a block structure in the link matrix is a closely related technique. However, none of these advanced methods is suitable for a fully decentralized PR computation in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network with autonomous peers, where each peer can independently crawl Web fragments according to the user’s thematic interests. In such a setting the graph fragments that different peers have locally available or know about may arbitrarily overlap among peers, creating additional complexity for the PR computation. This paper presents the JXP algorithm for dynamically and collaboratively computing PR scores of Web pages that are arbitrarily distributed in a P2P network. The algorithm runs at every peer, and it works by combining locally computed PR scores with random meetings among the peers in the network. It is scalable as the number of peers on the network grows, and experiments as well as theoretical arguments show that, after a certain number of peer meetings, JXP scores converge to the true PR scores that one would obtain by a centralized computation. To demonstrate the utility of the algorithm we have integrated the JXP scores into a P2P search engine in order to improve the ranking of the results. The paper also presents various run-time optimizations for combining the authority scores and the graph fragments during a meeting of two peers, and strategies for selecting the peers that a given peer should meet. A mathematical framework for the optimized version of JXP is also given, where important properties and the convergence proof of the algorithm are presented.},

@article{breiman1996bagging,

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

Computational linguistic and cognitive science work on discourse and dialogue relies

distinguishes between behaviours which tend to occur at or around discourse segment

If we consider each Wikipedia article as a node and each hyperlink between articles as an arc we have a “Wikigraph”, a graph that represents the link structure of Wikipedia. The Wikigraph differs from other Web graphs studied in the literature by the fact that there are timestamps associated with each node. The timestamps indicate the creation and update dates of each page, and this allows us to do a detailed analysis of the Wikipedia evolution over time. In the first part of this study we characterize this evolution in terms of users, editions and articles; in the second part, we depict the temporal evolution of several topological properties of the Wikigraph. The insights obtained from the Wikigraphs can be applied to large Web graphs from which the temporal data is usually not available.},

There is a need, however, to cater to the preferences of the users when supplying the search results to them. We propose to maintain the search profile of each user, on the basis of which the search results would be determined. This requires the integration of techniques for measuring search quality, learning from the user feedback and biased rank aggregation, etc. For the purpose of measuring web search quality, the "user satisfaction" is gauged by the sequence in which he picks up the results, the time he spends at those documents and whether or not he prints, saves, bookmarks, e-mails to someone or copies-and-pastes a portion of that document. For rank aggregation, we adopt and evaluate the classical fuzzy rank ordering techniques for web applications, and also propose a few novel techniques that outshine the existing techniques. A "user satisfaction" guided web search procedure is also put forward. Learning from the user feedback proceeds in such a way that there is an improvement in the ranking of the documents that are consistently preferred by the users. As an integration of our work, we propose a personalized web search system.},

Web community, defined as a set of Web-based documents with its own logical structure, is a flexible and efficient approach to support information retrieval and to implement various applications. Zhang and his co-authors explain how to construct and analyse Web communities based on information like Web document contents, hyperlinks, or user access logs. Their approaches combine results from Web search algorithms, Web clustering methods, and Web usage mining. They also detail the necessary preliminaries needed to understand the algorithms presented, and they discuss several successful existing applications.  Researchers and students in information retrieval and Web search find in this all the necessary basics and methods to create and understand Web communities.

data. Our specific interest is the analysis of basic statistics, the
identification of the semantic structure and age of the categories in this free
online encyclopedia, and the content coverage of its highly productive authors.
The paper starts with an introduction of Wikipedia and a review of related
work. We then introduce a suite of measures and approaches to analyze and map
the semantic structure of Wikipedia. The results show that co-occurrences of
categories within individual articles have a power-law distribution, and when
mapped reveal the nicely clustered semantic structure of Wikipedia. The results
also reveal the content coverage of the article's authors, although the roles
these authors play are as varied as the authors themselves. We conclude with a
discussion of major results and planned future work.},

In particular we measure a scale--invariant distribution of the in-- and out-- degree and we are able to reproduce these features by means of a simple statistical model. As a major consequence, Wikipedia growth can be described by local rules such as the preferential attachment mechanism, though users can act globally on the network.},

Strong scale-free regularities for page indegrees, outdegrees, and connected component sizes were in evidence, resulting in power laws similar to those previously identified for individual university Web sites and for the AltaVista-indexed Web. Anomalies were also discovered in most distributions and were tracked down to root causes. As a result, resource driven Web sites and automatically generated pages were identified as representing a significant break from the assumptions of previous power law models. It follows that attempts to track average Web linking behavior would benefit from using techniques to minimize or eliminate the impact of such anomalies.},

Topic-specific crawlers and information seeking agents should try not to traverse the off-topic areas and concentrate on links that lead to documents of interest. In this paper, we propose an effective approach based on the relevancy context graph to solve this problem. The graph can estimate the distance and the relevancy degree between the retrieved document and the given topic. By calculating the word distributions of the general and topic-specific feature words, our method will preserve the property of the relevancy context graph and reflect it on the word distributions. With the help of topic-specific and general word distribution, our crawler can measure a page's expected relevancy to a given topic and determine the order in which pages should be visited first. Simulations are also performed, and the results show that our method outperforms than the breath-first and the method using only the context graph.},

Under such a design, it is necessary to go through some pages to reach the destination pages, which is similar to the scenario of reaching an inner town of a peninsula through other towns at the edge of the peninsula. In this paper, we try to validate that peninsulas are a universal phenomenon in the World-Wide Web, and clarify how this phenomenon can be used to enhance web search and study web connectivity problems. For this purpose, we model the web as a directed graph, and give a proper definition of peninsulas based on this graph. We also present an efficient algorithm to find web peninsulas. Using data collected from the Chinese web by Tianwang search engine, we perform an experiment on the distribution of sizes of peninsulas and their correlations with PageRank values, outdegrees, or indegrees of the ties with other outside vertices. The results show that the peninsula structure on a web graph can greatly expedite the computation of PageRank values; and it can also significantly affect the link extraction capability and information coverage of web crawlers.},

A discussion is presented of the range of possible structures of networks of sexual contacts with extremes of assortative (within sexual activity groups) and disassortative (between sexual activity groups) mixing. The assortative mixing extreme is shown to generate the most rapid growth in the incidence of infection in the early stages of the epidemic while the disassortative extreme is shown to generate the epidemic of the largest magnitude over a long period. High within-group mixing (assortative) may generate multi-peak epidemics. The results are discussed in the context of both the interpretation of observed patterns of the spread of HIV and the acquisition of data on sexual contact patterns.},

	abstract = {While current studies on complex networks focus on systems that change relatively slowly in time, the structure of the most visited regions of the Web is altered at the timescale from hours to days. Here we investigate the dynamics of visitation of a major news portal, representing the prototype for such a rapidly evolving network. The nodes of the network can be classified into stable nodes, that form the time independent skeleton of the portal, and news documents. The visitation of the two node classes are markedly different, the skeleton acquiring visits at a constant rate, while a news document's visitation peaking after a few hours. We find that the visitation pattern of a news document decays as a power law, in contrast with the exponential prediction provided by simple models of site visitation. This is rooted in the inhomogeneous nature of the browsing pattern characterizing individual users: the time interval between consecutive visits by the same user to the site follows a power law distribution, in contrast with the exponential expected for Poisson processes. We show that the exponent characterizing the individual user's browsing patterns determines the power-law decay in a document's visitation. Finally, our results document the fleeting quality of news and events: while fifteen minutes of fame is still an exaggeration in the online media, we find that access to most news items significantly decays after 36 hours of posting.},

	abstract = {Random multiplicative processes $w_t =\lambda_1 \lambda_2 ... \lambda_t$
(with \&lt; \lambda_j \&gt; 0 ) lead, in the presence of a boundary constraint, to a
distribution $P(w_t)$ in the form of a power law $w_t^{-(1+\mu)}$. We provide a
simple and physically intuitive derivation of this result based on a random
walk analogy and show the following: 1) the result applies to the asymptotic
($t \to \infty$) distribution of $w_t$ and should be distinguished from the
central limit theorem which is a statement on the asymptotic distribution of
the reduced variable ${1 \over \sqrt{t}}(log w_t -\&lt; log w_t \&gt;)$; 2) the
necessary and sufficient conditions for $P(w_t)$ to be a power law are that
\&lt;log \lambda_j \&gt; \&lt; 0 (corresponding to a drift $w_t \to 0$) and that $w_t$ not
be allowed to become too small. We discuss several models, previously
unrelated, showing the common underlying mechanism for the generation of power
laws by multiplicative processes: the variable $\log w_t$ undergoes a random
walk biased to the left but is bounded by a repulsive ''force''. We give an
approximate treatment, which becomes exact for narrow or log-normal
distributions of $\lambda$, in terms of the Fokker-Planck equation. 3) For all
these models, the exponent $\mu$ is shown exactly to be the solution of
$\langle \lambda^{\mu} \rangle = 1$ and is therefore non-universal and depends
on the distribution of $\lambda$.},

Here we formulate a model for query incentive networks, motivated by such systems: users seeking information or services can pose queries, together with incentives for answering them, that are propagated along paths in a network. This type of information-seeking process can be formulated as a game among the nodes in the network, and this game has a natural Nash equilibrium.

In such systems, it is a fundamental question to understand how much incentive is needed in order for a node to achieve a reasonable probability of obtaining an answer to a query from the network. We study the size of query incentives as a function both of the rarity of the answer and the structure of the underlying network. This leads to natural questions related to strategic behavior in branching processes. Whereas the classically studied criticality of branching processes is centered around the region where the branching parameter is 1, we show in contrast that strategic interaction in incentive propagation exhibits critical behavior when the branching parameter is 2.},

normally calculated as the fraction of shortest paths between node pairs that

the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By
counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly
assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here we
propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including
contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest,
although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on
random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between
two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix

This paper reports the results of a major study examining the overlap among results retrieved by multiple Web search engines for a large set of more than 10,000 queries. Previous smaller studies have discussed a lack of overlap in results returned by Web search engines for the same queries. The goal of the current study was to conduct a large-scale study to measure the overlap of search results on the first result page (both non-sponsored and sponsored) across the four most popular Web search engines, at specific points in time using a large number of queries. The Web search engines included in the study were MSN Search, Google, Yahoo! and Ask Jeeves. Our study then compares these results with the first page results retrieved for the same queries by the metasearch engine Dogpile.com. Two sets of randomly selected user-entered queries, one set was 10,316 queries and the other 12,570 queries, from Infospace's Dogpile.com search engine (the first set was from Dogpile, the second was from across the Infospace Network of search properties were submitted to the four single Web search engines). Findings show that the percent of total results unique to only one of the four Web search engines was 84.9%, shared by two of the three Web search engines was 11.4%, shared by three of the Web search engines was 2.6%, and shared by all four Web search engines was 1.1%. This small degree of overlap shows the significant difference in the way major Web search engines retrieve and rank results in response to given queries. Results point to the value of metasearch engines in Web retrieval to overcome the biases of individual search engines.},

@inproceedings{wang2004improved,
	abstract = {Several link-based algorithms, such as PageRank [7], HITS [4] and SALSA [5], have been developed to evaluate the popularity of web pages. These algorithms can be interpreted as computing the steady-state distribution of various Markov processes over web pages. The PageRank and HITS algorithms tend to over-rank tightly interlinked collections of pages, such as well-organized message boards. We show that this effect can be alleviated using a number of modifications to the underlying Markov process. Specifically, rather than weight all outlinks from a given page equally, greater weight is given to links between pages that are, in other respects, further off in the web, and less weight is given to links between pages that are nearby. We have experimented with a number of variants of this idea, using a number of different measures of rdquodistancerdquo in the Web, and a number of different weighting schemes. We show that these revised algorithms often do avoid the over-ranking problem and give better overall rankings. This work is supported by NSF grant #IIS-0097537.

TrustRank is a recent algorithm that can combat web spam by propagating trust among web pages. However, TrustRank propagates trust among web pages based on the number of outgoing links, which is also how PageRank propagates authority scores among Web pages. This type of propagation may be suited for propagating authority, but it is not optimal for calculating trust scores for demoting spam sites. In this paper, we propose several alternative methods to propagate trust on the web. With experiments on a real web data set, we show that these methods can greatly decrease the number of web spam sites within the top portion of the trust ranking. In addition, we investigate the possibility of propagating distrust among web pages. Experiments show that combining trust and distrust values can demote more spam sites than the sole use of trust values.},

trust is propagated fwds, distrust backwards

Tested three forms of branching: normal branching (each child gets 1/outdegree), constant branching (each child gets all of the score of its parent), and logarithmic branching (a compromise between these two).

Score(page) = eta*trust - beta*distrust

For spam detection, experimentally eta should be 0.0-0.1 and beta 0.9-1.0, so distrust is much more important.

It's better to use logarithmic branching than constant branching, and it's better to use maximum than sum.

@inproceedings{baeza2006generalizing,
	abstract = {This paper introduces a family of link-based ranking algorithms that propagate page importance through links. In these algorithms there is a damping function that decreases with distance, so a direct link implies more endorsement than a link through a long path. PageRank is the most widely known ranking function of this family. The main objective of this paper is to determine whether this family of ranking techniques has some interest per se, and how different choices for the damping function impact on rank quality and on convergence speed. Even though our results suggest that PageRank can be approximated with other simpler forms of rankings that may be computed more efficiently, our focus is of more speculative nature, in that it aims at separating the kernel of PageRank, that is, link-based importance propagation, from the way propagation decays over paths. We focus on three damping functions, having linear, exponential, and hyperbolic decay on the lengths of the paths. The exponential decay corresponds to PageRank, and the other functions are new. Our presentation includes algorithms, analysis, comparisons and experiments that study their behavior under different parameters in real Web graph data. Among other results, we show how to calculate a linear approximation that induces a page ordering that is almost identical to PageRank's using a fixed small number of iterations; comparisons were performed using Kendall's tau on large domain datasets.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a technique for automating the detection of Web link spam, that is, groups of pages that are linked together with the sole purpose of obtaining an undeservedly high score in search engines. The problem of Web spam is widespread and difficult to solve, mostly due to the large size of web collections that makes many algorithms unfeasible in practice. For spam detection we apply only link-based methods, that is, we only study the topology of the Web graph without looking at the contents of the pages. We compute Web page attributes applying rank propagation and probabilistic counting over the Web graph. These attributes are used to build a classifier that is tested over a large collection of Web link spam. After ten-fold cross-validation, our best classifier can detect about 80% of the spam pages with a rate of false positives of 2%. This is competitive with state-of-the-art spam classifiers that use content attributes, and is the first automatic classifier that achieves this precision using only link data.},

@article{eckmann2002curvature,
	abstract = {Beyond the information stored in pages of the World Wide Web, novel types of "meta-information" are created when pages connect to each other. Such meta-information is a collective effect of independent agents writing and linking pages, hidden from the casual user. Accessing it and understanding the interrelation between connectivity and content in the World Wide Web is a challenging problem [Botafogo, R. A. \& Shneiderman, B. (1991) in Proceedings of Hypertext (Assoc. Comput. Mach., New York), pp. 63-77 and Albert, R. \& Barabasi, A.-L. (2002) Rev. Mod. Phys. 74, 47-97]. We demonstrate here how thematic relationships can be located precisely by looking only at the graph of hyperlinks, gleaning content and context from the Web without having to read what is in the pages. We begin by noting that reciprocal links (co-links) between pages signal a mutual recognition of authors and then focus on triangles containing such links, because triangles indicate a transitive relation. The importance of triangles is quantified by the clustering coefficient [Watts, D. J. \& Strogatz, S. H. (1999) Nature (London) 393, 440-442], which we interpret as a curvature [Bridson, M. R. \& Haefliger, A. (1999) Metric Spaces of Non-Positive Curvature (Springer, Berlin)]. This curvature defines a World Wide Web landscape whose connected regions of high curvature characterize a common topic. We show experimentally that reciprocity and curvature, when combined, accurately capture this meta-information for a wide variety of topics. As an example of future directions we analyze the neural network of Caenorhabditis elegans, using the same methods.},

	abstract = {The understanding of the immense and intricate topological structure of the World Wide Web (WWW) is a major scientific and technological challenge. This has been tackled recently by characterizing the properties of its representative graphs in which vertices and directed edges are identified with web-pages and hyperlinks, respectively. Data gathered in large scale crawls have been analyzed by several groups resulting in a general picture of the WWW that encompasses many of the complex properties typical of rapidly evolving networks. In this paper, we report a detailed statistical analysis of the topological properties of four different WWW graphs obtained with different crawlers. We find that, despite the very large size of the samples, the statistical measures characterizing these graphs differ quantitatively, and in some cases qualitatively, depending on the domain analyzed and the crawl used for gathering the data. This spurs the issue of the presence of sampling biases and structural differences of Web domains that might induce properties not representative of the actual global underlying graph. In order to provide a more accurate characterization of the Web graph and identify observables which are clearly discriminating with respect to the sampling process, we study the behavior of degree-degree correlation functions and the statistics of reciprocal connections. The latter appears to enclose the relevant correlations of the WWW graph and carry most of the topological information of theWeb. The analysis of this quantity is also of major interest in relation to the navigability and searchability of the Web.},

@inproceedings{metaxas2005web,
	abstract = {Web spamming, the practice of introducing artificial text and links into web pages to affect the results of searches, has been recognized as a ma jor problem for search engin es. It is also a serious problem for users because they are not aware of it and they tend to confuse trusting the search engine with trusting the results of a search. In this paper, we first analyze the influence that web spam has on the evolution of the search engines and we identify the strong relationship of spamming methods to propagandistic techniques in society. Our analysis provides a foundation to understanding why spamming works and offers new insight on how to address it. In particular, it suggest that one could use anti-propagandistic techniques in the web to recognize spam. The second part of the paper demonstrates such a technique, called backwards propagation of distrust. I n society, recognition of an untrustworthy message (in the opinion of a particular person or other social entity) is a reason for questioning the entities that recommend the message. Entities that are found to strongly support untrustworthy messages become untrustworthy themselves. So, social distrust is propagated backwards for a number of steps . Our algorithm simulates this social behavior on the web graph. In our algorithm, starting from an untrustworthy (according to the end user) site s, we examine its trust nei ghborhood, that is, the neighborhood of sites that link to s in a few steps. Evaluating the sites-members of the neighborhood we identify a biconnected component (BCCs) with a high percentage of untrustworthy sites. BCCs are formed when there are multiple paths to reach s, thus indicating a concerted effort to promote s. This is not the case when starting from a trustworthy site. Our tool explores thousands of nodes within minutes and could be deployed at the browser-level, making it possible to resolve the moral que stion of who should be making the decision of weeding out spammers in favor of the end user. Our approach can lead to browser-level web spam filters that work in synergy with the powerful search engines to deliver personalized, trusted web results.},

Can a Web crawler efficiently locate an unknown relevant page? These questions are receiving much attention due to their potential impact for understanding the structure of the Web and for building better search engines. Here I investigate the connection between the linkage and content topology of Web pages. The relationship between a text-induced distance metric and a link-based neighborhood probability distribution displays a phase transition between a region where linkage is not determined by content and one where linkage decays according to a power law. This relationship is used to propose a Web growth model that is shown to accurately predict the distribution of Web page degree, based on textual content and assuming only local knowledge of degree for existing pages. A qualitatively similar phase transition is found between linkage and semantic distance, with an exponential decay tail. Both relationships suggest that efficient paths can be discovered by decentralized Web navigation algorithms based on textual and/or categorical cues.},

Although the Web page is the typical indivisible unit of information in search engine results and most Web information retrieval algorithms, other research has suggested that aggregating pages based on directories and domains gives promising alternatives, particularly when Web links are the object of study. The new algorithms introduced based on these alternatives were used to rank four sets of Web pages. The ranking results were compared with human subjects\&#039; rankings. The results of the tests were somewhat inconclusive: the new approach worked well for the set that includes pages from different Web sites; however, it does not work well in ranking pages that are from the same site. It seems that the new algorithms may be effective for some tasks but not for others, especially when only low numbers of links are involved or the pages to be ranked are from the same site or directory.},

The review is preceded by a brief historical survey of the developments of RMT and of localization theory since their inception. We emphasize the concepts common to the above-mentioned fields as well as the great diversity of RMT. In view of the universality of RMT, we suggest that the current development signals the emergence of a new "statistical mechanics": Stochasticity and general symmetry requirements lead to universal laws not based on dynamical principles.},

	abstract = {In-degree, PageRank, number of visits and other measures of Web page popularity significantly influence the ranking of search results by modern search engines. The assumption is that popularity is closely correlated with quality, a more elusive concept that is difficult to measure directly. Unfortunately, the correlation between popularity and quality is very weak for newly-created pages that have yet to receive many visits and/or in-links. Worse, since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search engines, and because users usually focus their attention on the top few results, newly-created but high-quality pages are effectively “shut out,” and it can take a very long time before they become popular. We propose a simple and elegant solution to this problem: the introduction of a controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods. Doing so offers new pages a chance to prove their worth, although clearly using too much randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved. Hence there is a tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality. We study this tradeoff both analytically and via simulation, in the context of an economic objective function based on aggregate result quality amortized over time. We show that a modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results.},

	abstract = {It is shown, following Shockley [Shockley, W. (1957) Proc. IRE 45, 279-290], that, when a population is engaged in tasks whose completion requires the successful conclusion of many independent subtasks, the distribution function for successes in the primary task is log normal. It is also shown that, when the dispersion of the log-normal distribution is large, the distribution is mimicked by a 1/x distribution over a wide range of x. This argument provides a generic set of processes that yields the much observed 1/x distribution, and will also lead to a 1/f noise spectrum. It is commonly found that distributions that seem to be log normal over a broad range (say to the 95th percentile of a population) change to an inverse fractional power (Pareto) distribution for the last few percentile. Annual income distributions are examples with this structure. The very wealthy generally achieve their superwealth through amplification processes that are not available to most. We have introduced a simple amplification model to characterize the transition from a log-normal distribution to an inverse-power Pareto tail.},

Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, moon craters and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.},

In trying to learn enough about these distributions to settle the question, I found a rich and long history, spanning many fields. Indeed, several recently proposed models from the computer science community have antecedents in work from decades ago. Here, I briefly survey some of this history, focusing on underlying generative models that lead to these distributions. One finding is that lognormal and power law distributions connect quite naturally, and hence, it is not surprising that lognormal distributions have arisen as a possible alternative to power law distributions across many fields.},

support the conjecture that self-similar scale-free networks are not

disassortative instead. We also find that the qualitative feature of
disassortativity is scale-invariant under renormalization, but it appears as an
intrinsic feature of the renormalization prescription, as even assortative

The analysis, discrimination, and synthesis of complex networks therefore rely on the use of measurements capable of expressing the most relevant topological features. This article presents a survey of such measurements. It includes general considerations about complex network characterization, a brief review of the principal models, and the presentation of the main existing measurements organized into classes. Special attention is given to relating complex network analysis with the areas of pattern recognition and feature selection, as well as on surveying some concepts and measurements from traditional graph theory which are potentially useful for complex network research. Depending on the network and the analysis task one has in mind, a specific set of features may be chosen. It is hoped that the present survey will help the identification of suitable measurements.},

technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and
biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the
focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their
topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real
networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the
connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past
studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e. either
present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the
world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of
social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is
possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the
intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the
network. We define new appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological
observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties
and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This
information allows us to investigate for the first time the correlations among
weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network.
These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and
organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted

Arguments are presented to explain why this is not necessarily optimal and why other alternatives have the potential to produce better results. This is despite the fact that individual Web files are often the only choice if search engines are used for raw data and are the easiest basic Web unit to identify. The central issue is of defining the Web <IMG SRC="/giflibrary/12/ldquo.gif" BORDER="0">document<IMG SRC="/giflibrary/12/rdquo.gif" BORDER="0">: that which should comprise the single indissoluble unit of coherent material. Three alternative heuristics are defined for the educational arena based upon the directory, the domain and the whole university site. These are then compared by implementing them on a set of 108 UK university institutional Web sites under the assumption that a more effective heuristic will tend to produce results that correlate more highly with institutional research productivity. It was discovered that the domain and directory models were able to successfully reduce the impact of anomalous linking behavior between pairs of Web sites, with the latter being the method of choice. Reasons are then given as to why a document model on its own cannot eliminate all anomalies in Web linking behavior. Finally, the results from all models give a clear confirmation of the very strong association between the research productivity of a UK university and the number of incoming links from its peers' Web sites.},

Hostgraph is used, and the sum of pageranks of pages in the hostgraph is used.

A page that is not too deep in a website inherits the score of the site, while a page that is deeper (exponential decay, theta=4) should have decaying correlation.

Iterative calculation is done to reinforce website score using page score and viceversa.

Link-based ranking should be 60-80% of the total score (the other 40-20% is text similarity with the query)

Random clicking almost never occur (weights for the links). "The real-world surfer is not so stupid as to follow a uniformly random clicking pattern". 

Two-layer graph model, in which the sum of the page importances is part of the ranking. The upper layer (sites) has an hyperbolically decreasing effect on its pages based on their depth), in practice, a quadratic correlation is OK.

By introducing this, the power-law exponent grows, the range of page importance is shortened as ranking flows to more pages.},

Whence the hero of Smolin's tale, the as-yet-incomplete quantum theory of gravity, which seeks to unify relativity and quantum theory--and, in the bargain, to move toward a "grand theory of everything." Smolin ably explains concepts that underlie quantum gravity, such as background independence, the superposition principle, and the notion of causal structure, and he traces the development of allied theories that have shaped modern physics and led to this new view of the universe.<p>  Although he allows that "it has not been possible to test any of our new theories of quantum gravity experimentally," Smolin predicts that a solid framework will be established by 2015 at the outside. If he's correct, the years in between promise to be an exciting time for students of the physical sciences, and Smolin's book makes an engaging introduction to some of the big questions they'll be asking. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I> } {From one of the world's most distinguished scientists, the first popular book to present the controversial and exciting ideas behind quantum gravity.   <P>The Holy Grail of modern physics is a theory of the universe that unites two seemingly opposing pillars of modern science: Einstein's theory of general relativity, which deals with large-scale phenomena (planets, solar systems and galaxies), and quantum theory, which deals with the world of the very small (molecules, atoms, electrons).  <P>In <I>Three Roads to Quantum Gravity</I>, Lee Smolin provides the first concise and accessible overview of current attempts to reconcile these two theories in a final "theory of everything." This is the closest anyone has ever come to devising a completely new theory of space, time and the universe to replace the Newtonian ideas that were the foundation of all science until the beginning of the twentieth century.  <P>Lee Smolin, who has spent his career at the forefront of these new discoveries, presents for the first time the main ideas behind the new developments that have brought a quantum theory of gravity in sight. He explains in simple terms what scientists are talking about when they say the world is made from exotic entities such as loops, strings, and black holes.

physics, but even in pure mathematics, in logic, in the world of pure
reason. Sometimes mathematical truth is completely random and has no

comprehension is compression, i.e., explaining many facts using few theoretical
assumptions, and that a theory may be viewed as a computer program for
calculating observations. This provides motivation for defining the complexity
of something to be the size of the simplest theory for it, in other words, the
size of the smallest program for calculating it. This is the central idea of
algorithmic information theory (AIT), a field of theoretical computer science.
Using the mathematical concept of program-size complexity, we exhibit
irreducible mathematical facts, mathematical facts that cannot be demonstrated
using any mathematical theory simpler than they are. It follows that the world
of mathematical ideas has infinite complexity and is therefore not fully
comprehensible, at least not in a static fashion. Whether the physical world
has finite or infinite complexity remains to be seen. Current science believes
that the world contains randomness, and is therefore also infinitely complex,

also a possibility, at least according to recent highly speculative work of S.

Since the early '90s, the Web has grown exponentially - a trend we expect will continue. Today's Webgraph has several billion edges, but in spite of its size, it exhibits a well-defined structure characterized by several properties. In the past few years, several research papers have reported these properties and proposed various random graph models. We simulated several of these models and compared them against a 300-million-node sample of the Webgraph provided by the Stanford WebBase project (http://www-diglib.stanford.edu//spl sim/testbed/doc2/WebBase/). All the software we developed to perform this comparison is free to download from the European Research Project COSIN Web site (www.cosin.org). Over the past six years, computer scientists, economists, mathematicians, and physicists have extensively studied the Webgraph's properties. All this research was motivated primarily by the need to efficiently mine the huge quantities of information on the Web - information that is often distributed among several pages. The first major discovery concerned in-degree, an intuitive and simplistic measure of page importance. (Each node in a directed graph is characterized by in-degree and out-degree - the number of incoming and outgoing links, respectively).},

@book{dogorovstev03evolution,
	abstract = {Only recently did mankind realize that it resides on a world of networks. The Internet and the World Wide Web are changing our life. Our physical existence is based on various biological networks. We have recently learned that the term ""network"" turns out to be a central notion in our time, and the onsequent explosion of interest in networks is a social and cultural phenomenon. The principles of the complex organization and evolution of networks, natural and artificial are the topic of this book, which is written by physicists and is addressed to all involved researchers and students. The aim of the text is to understand networks and the basic principles of their structural organization and evolution. The ideas are presneted in a clear and pedegogical way, with minimal mathematics, so even students without a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistical physics will be able to rely on this as a reference. Special attention is given to real networks, both natural and artificial. Collected empirical data and numerous real applications of existing theories are discussed in detail, as well as the topical problems of communication networks.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been considerable interest in the structure and dynamics of complex networks. One of the most studied networks is the linear Barabasi-Albert model. Here we investigate the nonlinear Barabasi-Albert growing network. In this model, a new node connects to a vertex of degree k with a probability proportional to k[alpha] ([alpha] real). Each vertex adds m new edges to the network. We derive an analytic expression for the degree distribution P(k) which is valid for all values of m and [alpha][les]1. In the limit [alpha]->-[infin] the network is homogeneous. If [alpha]>1 there is a gel phase with m super-connected nodes. It is proposed a formula for the clustering coefficient which is in good agreement with numerical simulations. The assortativity coefficient r is determined and it is shown that the nonlinear Barabasi-Albert network is assortative (disassortative) if [alpha]1) and no assortative only when [alpha]=1. In the limit [alpha]->-[infin] the assortativity coefficient can be exactly calculated. We find  when m=2. Finally, the minimum average shortest path length lmin is numerically evaluated. Increasing the network size, lmin diverges for [alpha][les]1 and it is equal to 1 when [alpha]>1.},

detailed statistics of numbers in the World Wide Web, finding that their
distribution is a heavy-tailed dependence which splits in a set of power-law
ones. In particular, we find that the frequency of numbers associated to
western calendar years shows an uneven behavior: 2004 represents a `singular
critical' point, appearing with a strikingly high frequency; as we move away
from it, the decreasing frequency allows us to compare the amounts of existing
information on the past and on the future. Moreover, while powers of ten occur
extremely often, allowing us to obtain statistics up to the huge 10^127,
`non-round' numbers occur in a much more limited range, the variations of their
frequencies being dramatically different from standard statistical
fluctuations. These findings provide a view of the array of numbers used by
humans as a highly non-equilibrium and inhomogeneous system, and shed a new

	abstract = {This work reports on how the formalization of complex network concepts in
terms of discrete mathematics, especially mathematical morphology, allows a
series of generalizations and important results ranging from new measurements
of the network topology to new network growth models. First, the concepts of
node degree and clustering coefficient are extended in order to characterize
not only specific nodes, but any generic subnetwork. Second, the consideration
of distance transform and rings are used to further extend those concepts in
order to obtain a signature, instead of a single scalar measurement, ranging
from the single node to whole graph scales. The use of the closing operation is
also proposed as a means to analyze the proximity of 3-cycles along a complex
network. The potential of such concepts is illustrated with respect to the
random and Barab\'asi-Albert models, as well as distance-based
preferential-attachment networks. A generalization of the Barab\'asi-Albert
network, characterized by preferential attachment with respect to the
generalized degree, is also proposed and shown to exhibit properties which are
intermediate between the Barab\'asi-Albert and random models. Each of these
cases is characterized and analyzed with respect to particularly relevant
subnetworks contained in the original complex network, namely hubs, 3-cycles
and outmost nodes.},

These results are corroborated by the investigation of an Ising model defined on the network, showing for every finite disorder fraction a crossover from a high-temperature region dominated by the underlying one-dimensional structure to a mean-field like low-temperature region. In particular there exists a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase transition as soon as the disorder strength is finite. [0.5cm\&#93;},

We place particular emphasis on network theory---the topic of this special issue---and its importance in augmenting the framework for the quantitative study of complex systems. In order to illustrate the main issues, we briefly review several areas where network theory has led to significant developments in our understanding of complex systems. Specifically, we discuss changes, arising from network theory, in our understanding of (i) the Internet and other communication networks, (ii) the structure of natural ecosystems, (iii) the spread of diseases and information, (iv) the structure of cellular signalling networks, and (v) infrastructure robustness. Finally, we discuss how complexity requires both new tools and an augmentation of the conceptual framework---including an expanded definition of what is meant by a “quantitative prediction.”},

@article{newman01random,
	abstract = {Recent work on the structure of social networks and the internet has focused attention on graphs with distributions of vertex degree that are significantly different from the Poisson degree distributions that have been widely studied in the past. In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.},

The pages of a country are an interesting set for studying the characteristics of the Web, because at the same time they are diverse (as they are written by several authors) and consistent (as they share a common geographical, historical and cultural context). This paper discusses the methodologies used for presenting the results of Web characterization studies, including the granularity at which different aspects are presented, and a separation of concerns between contents, links, and technologies. Based on this, we present a side-by-side comparison of the results of 12 Web characterization studies comprising over 120 million pages from 24 countries. The comparison unveils similarities and differences between the collections, and sheds light on how certain results of a single Web characterization study may be valid in the context of the full Web.},

A revisionist view shows that when cartel members compete in other activities, i.e. when they semi-collude, the cartel members may be worse off and consumers better off. Using a two-stage model in which the non-production activity is R{\&}D and is subject to technological spillovers, we show that both the traditional and revisionist views can be wrong, that consumers and producers can both be made worse off, or both better off, by a semi-collusive production cartel.},

@book{barabasi02linked,
	abstract = {How is the human brain like the AIDS epidemic? Ask physicist Albert-László Barabási and he'll explain them both in terms of networks of individual nodes connected via complex but understandable relationships. <I>Linked: The New Science of Networks</I> is his bright, accessible guide to the fundamentals underlying neurology, epidemiology, Internet traffic, and many other fields united by complexity.<p> Barabási's gift for concrete, nonmathematical explanations and penchant for eccentric humor would make the book thoroughly enjoyable even if the content weren't engaging. But the results of Barabási's research into the behavior of networks are deeply compelling. Not all networks are created equal, he says, and he shows how even fairly robust systems like the Internet could be crippled by taking out a few super-connected nodes, or hubs. His mathematical descriptions of this behavior are helping doctors, programmers, and security professionals design systems better suited to their needs. <I>Linked</I> presents the next step in complexity theory--from understanding chaos to practical applications. <I>--Rob Lightner</I> The first book to explore the hot new science of networks and their impact on nature, business, medicine, and everyday life. <P>In the 1980's, James Gleick's <I>Chaos</I> introduced the world to complexity. Now, Albert-László Barabási's <I>Linked</I> reveals the next major scientific leap: the study of networks. <P>We've long suspected that we live in a small world, where everything is connected to everything else. Indeed, networks are pervasive--from the human brain to the Internet to the economy to our group of friends. These linkages, it turns out, aren't random. All networks, to the great surprise of scientists, have an underlying order and follow simple laws. Understanding the structure and behavior of these networks will help us do some amazing things, from designing the optimal organization of a firm to stopping a disease outbreak before it spreads catastrophically. <P>In <I>Linked</I>, Barabási, a physicist whose work has revolutionized the study of networks, traces the development of this rapidly unfolding science and introduces us to the scientists carrying out this pioneering work. These "new cartographers" are mapping networks in a wide range of scientific disciplines, proving that social networks, corporations, and cells are more similar than they are different, and providing important new insights into the interconnected world around us. This knowledge, says Barabási, can shed light on the robustness of the Internet, the spread of fads and viruses, even the future of democracy. Engaging and authoritative, <I>Linked</I> provides an exciting preview of the next century in science, guaranteed to be transformed by these amazing discoveries. <P>From <I>Linked</I>: <P>This book has a simple message: think networks. It is about how networks emerge, what they look like, and how they evolve. It aims to develop a web-based view of nature, society, and technology, providing a unified framework to better understand issues ranging from the vulnerability of the Internet to the spread of diseases. Networks are present everywhere. All we need is an eye for them...We will see the challenges doctors face when they attempt to cure a disease by focusing on a single molecule or gene, disregarding the complex interconnected nature of the living matter. We will see that hackers are not alone in attacking networks: we all play Goliath, firing shots at a fragile ecological network that, without further support, could soon replicate our worst nightmares by turning us into an isolated group of species...Linked is meant to be an eye-opening trip that challenges you to walk across disciplines by stepping out of the box of reductionism. It is an invitation to explore link by link the next scientific revolution: the new science of networks.},

	abstract = {We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networks-natural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups. Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible "betweenness" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},
